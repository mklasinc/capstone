NOTES


////////////////////////   MATLAB CODE   ///////////////////////////////////////////
1. change the sphere dimensions to actual dimensions (in mm)
2. to satisfy IRB criteria, the names of subjects should be anonymized
3. condition: spell it out in the data â€”> real vs. virtual instead of 0 and 1
4. information about the previous trials (apparently Ivan did something similar before)

Later in the data analysis
Add L-R differences between the spheres 





////////////////////////   DATA ANALYSIS    ////////////////////////////////////////

1. open MihaData.proj (sets the R directory)
2. open Cut_data


you check the trials one by one

FIRST CHECK
see visually if the trajectories are correct
notrials() - put in the trial number you want to delete

SECOND CHECK
check visually if the trials are cut correctly

THIRD CHECK
plot everything in R

Cut_data
FindEndMovement - this finds the end movement 


Analysis.R
